I am a PhD student at the [British Antarctic Survey](https://www.bas.ac.uk/) and the [Machine Learning Group](https://cbl-website.onrender.com/) (University of Cambridge), supervised by [Dr Andrew Orr](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/anmcr/), [Prof Rich Turner](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/profiles/ret26) and [Dr Scott Hosking](http://scotthosking.com). 

My research interests include probabilistic modelling for environmental and climate sciences. I am currently working on improving precipitation and river flow predictions in data-scarce mountain regions, such as the Himalayas, and exploring how this translates into actionable information for better decision making. 

My background is in [civil engineering](https://www.upc.edu/en/masters/civil-engineering), [hydrology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/civil-engineering/prospective-students/postgraduate-taught-admissions/environmental-engineering-cluster/msc-hydrology-and-water-resources-management/) and [environmental data science](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/).

<!-- I hold an MRes in [Environmental Data Science](https://ai4er-cdt.esc.cam.ac.uk/) from the University of Cambridge, an MSc in [Hydrology and Water Resources Management](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/civil-engineering/prospective-students/postgraduate-taught-admissions/environmental-engineering-cluster/msc-hydrology-and-water-resources-management/) from Imperial College London, and an MEng in [Civil Engineering](https://www.upc.edu/en/masters/civil-engineering) from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (BarcelonaTECH). -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
